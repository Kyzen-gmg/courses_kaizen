- Remedy 2: Imagine and mentally accept the worst-case scenario
    - COMMENT: Very similar to Seneca/Stoicism  
    - COMMENT: "When we force ourselves to face the worst and accept it mentally, we then eliminate all those vague imaginings and put ourselves in a position in which we are able to concetnrate on our problem." - Willis Carrier (Air Conditioner Founder)

    1. Urgent & Important tasks (Create a list and Eat the Frog)
        - Task #1:  
        - Task #2: 
        - Task #3:  
        - Task #4:  
        - Task #5:  
    2. Visualize that at the end of the day--NOTHING got done!!
    3. Accept that reality
    4. Ask yourself "How can I improve upon this horrible day?"
    5. Any tasks you finish today will now feel like a bonus. Suddenly that list you were worried about, becomes a list of opportunities.

- Remedy 3: Live in Day-tight Compartments  
    How it works:  
    Visualize that you are a captain of a ship. If one of the ship's compartment's start to take in water, Activate the IRON DOORS to prevent other compartments being flooded.  
    ```
    |       Yesterday       |       Today       |       Tomorrow        |
    |                       |                   |                       |
    |       *Bad Day*       |                   |       *Worries*       |
    |        *Fears*        |                   |       *Anxiety*       |
    |        *Regret*       |                   |                       |
    |       *Saddnses*      |                   |                       |
    |      *Depression*     |                   |                       |
    ```
    To activate your IRON DOORS:  
    1. Wake up every morning and Imagine that you're living a new life. Imagine your old self had died last night and your worries and your regrets died with him. And this morning is the first day of the rest of your your life.  
    2. If I take care of today, tomorrow will take care of itself.
